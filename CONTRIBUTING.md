# Contributing to `sauce-testcafe-runner`

**Thank you for your interest in `sauce-testcafe-runner`. We highly value your contributions.**

There are several ways to get involved:

- [Report a Bug](#report-a-bug)
- [Suggest a Feature](#suggest-a-feature)
- [Contribute Code](#contribute-code)

Please follow the guidelines outlined below. If you need assistance, don't hesitate to open an issue.

## Report a Bug
Reporting bugs is a valuable way to contribute. Before creating a bug report, please check if an [existing issue](/issues) already addresses the problem. If one exists, feel free to add your observations as a comment.

To report a new bug:
- Open an issue summarizing the bug.
- Label it as "bug."
- If you are prepared to provide a fix, that's excellent! In that case, submit a pull request as described in the [Contribute Code](#contribute-code) section.

## Suggest a Feature
To suggest a new feature:
- Open a [new issue](../../issues/new).
- Summarize the desired functionality and its use case.
- Label the issue as "feature."

## Contribute Code
The following outlines our workflow for code contributions:

1. Browse the list of [open issues](../../issues). Choose one to work on, or create a new one to discuss your ideas.
2. It's best to discuss your plans beforehand to ensure alignment with our project goals.
3. Fork the repository on GitHub.
4. Create a topic branch from `main`.
5. Start a new pull request, label it `work in progress`, and describe your intended contributions.
6. Commit logical and self-contained changes.
7. Ensure each commit is signed off (`git commit -s -m "your message"`), as a sign of your agreement to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO).
8. Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork.
9. Update the pull request with new information and completed tasks.
10. Engage with any feedback from project maintainers.
11. Once complete, remove the `work in progress` label and request a review from the maintainers.
12. Your pull request requires approval from at least two [maintainers](MAINTAINERS).

### Commit Messages
Your commit messages should clearly answer two questions: what changed and why. The subject line should focus on what changed, while the body provides the reason.

Link the pull request to the relevant issue id.

```
git commit -s -m "adding X to change Y"
```

**Enjoy contributing and happy coding!**
